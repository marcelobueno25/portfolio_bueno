From an early age, I pursued learning on my own, getting involved in social projects, studying independently, and always looking for ways to reinvent myself. I value collaborative environments where I can learn, contribute, and grow with purpose. I'm practical, committed, and enjoy solving problems with clarity. I adapt easily to new challenges and believe that technology only makes sense when it connects people and creates a positive impact.",
